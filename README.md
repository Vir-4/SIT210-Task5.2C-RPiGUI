Task 5.2C RPi - Making GUI
In this task, we created simple GUI interfaces with Raspberry Pi. RPi supports python, which has many GUI packages including Qt, TkInter and Kivy. In this task I used python programming language incorporating RPi. 
Moreover, based on what we learnt from the TkInter video tutorial, we build a simple GUI interface to turn on one of LED lights.
